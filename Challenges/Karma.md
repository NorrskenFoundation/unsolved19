## Create a technology-based solution to put an end to food waste in the home

### Challenge

Globally, about one third of all food produced is wasted. Given that agriculture and food production cause up to 23% of yearly net global greenhouse gas emissions, this (largely avoidable) waste represents an opportunity to eliminate a substantial driver of human-caused climate change. 

Like many other facets of environmental impact, developed countries (such as Sweden) have an outsized per-capita impact; in Europe and North America, the average person wastes 95-115kg of food per year, compared to 6-11kg per year in sub-Saharan Africa and South/Southeast Asia.1 In fact, the amount of food wasted in higher income countries is roughly equal to the total net food production in Sub-Saharan Africa1. While food waste in developing countries happens mostly during post-harvest, processing, and distribution, in industrialized countries, about one third of this waste happens at the consumer level<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>.
