# unsolved 2019 


Unsolved is an unconference where the most brilliant minds in impact tech are gathered to hash out how we can use technology to solve some of the biggest challenges of our time. One part of Unsolved is Hack for Impact. The participants in the hackathon will work with four different real life humanitarian cases that all address world issues related to the Agenda 2030 goals. 

This Github repo contains information and resources by and for the Norrsken Hack for impact hackathon. For more information, visit out website at [www.hackforimpact.norrskenimpactweek.org](https://hackforimpact.norrskenimpactweek.org/)

## Challenges

  * [Doctrin](Challenges/Doctrin.md)
  * [EricssonLogistics](Challenges/EricssonLogistics.md)
  * [EricssonWeather](Challenges/EricssonWeather.md)
  * [Karma](Challenges/Karma.md)



## Submit solution 
Every team must create a new repository on GitHub. To submit your solution, one of your team members must email the link to unsolved@norrskenfoundation.org before 18.45. After that time we will not be able to judge your solution. The subject of the email should be your team name and the case you have been working on. The README file should contain the following information:


* Team name
* Team members
* Chosen case
* Our solution: (a short description of the idea)
* Presentation slides (optional)
* Applied license
* Services used
* Languages used

## Pitch
As this is a short and intense hackathon with 26 competing teams, only 10 teams will get the chance to pitch their solution to the audience. Representatives from Norrsken will select the finalists in the Karma and Doctrin cases and Ericsson will select the finalists in their cases. 

The finalists will be announced in the beginning of the pitch event. There will be no time to prepare a presentation once the finalists have been announced, meaning that all teams must be ready to pitch their solution from their own laptops. You can choose whatever presentation tool you want but it must have the format 16:9. The pitch time is limited to three minutes, so keep it short and sweet!

## Prize categories

The pitching teams will compete in three different categories. A voting audience will pick the winners in the categories Best Pitch and Best Technical Solution.

The final prize category is presented by our sponsor Ericsson and is called the Game Changer Award. This award goes to the most feasible, scalable and viable idea with possibility to make an impact today. The winner will be chosen by a jury with Ericsson and Norrsken representatives.
